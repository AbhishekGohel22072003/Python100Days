# Instructions:-

#You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log. 
#You can see a travel_log which is a List that contains 2 Dictionaries.

#If you type the following (i.e.calling a function):
# add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])
#then it should add this accordingly into the travel_log

# DO NOT modify the travel_log directly. You need to create a function that modifies it.

#TODO: Write the function that will allow new countries
#to be added to the travel_log. ðŸ‘‡
