A = 123_456_789
print(A)
# Output : 123456789
# Question : Why the underscores are not being printed?
# Answer : In Python, underscores in numeric literals are used solely for visual clarity, making large numbers easier to read. They don't affect the value of the number and are not part of the number itself. When the number is printed, the underscores are not included in the output.


# print(len(123))
# Error
# as in python, we cannot calculate the length of integer

a = 12
b = a/2
print(b)  #Output: 6.0
